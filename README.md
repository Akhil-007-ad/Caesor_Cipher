# Caesar Cipher Encoder & Decoder (Java)

This project is a simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** in Java. It takes user input, encrypts it using a Caesar shift, and then decrypts it to show the original message. It demonstrates foundational programming concepts like string manipulation, classes, and user interaction.

## 📌 Features

- 🔐 **Encrypt** messages using Caesar Cipher (default shift of 3).
- 🔓 **Decrypt** messages back to original form.
- 📟 Console-based input/output.
- 🧠 Clear example of Java OOP and basic algorithm logic.

## 📂 File Structure

- **Encoding_msg**: Class to encrypt a message using Caesar Cipher.
- **Decoding_msg**: Class to decrypt the message.
- **Topic_2**: The main class that interacts with the user and integrates both encryption and decryption.
